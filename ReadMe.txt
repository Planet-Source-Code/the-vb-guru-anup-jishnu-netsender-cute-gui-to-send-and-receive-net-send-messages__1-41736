NetSender v:1.1
	Designed and Developed By Anup Jishnu (AnupJishnu@hotmail.com)

	There have been many times when we developers and others using computers on a network want to send urgent messages to each other. We make use of the net send command from the command prompt to send messages.
	
	I found it very useful and Microsoft has not removed it, though its a very old tool.
	
	But one thing always used to bug me. When I want to send a net send message to more than one computer at a time, I had to type out each computer name, it is very tedious.
	
	Colleagues used to send me net send messages and I had copy them from the disturbing message boxes into notepad from where I would read them after making myself free from the existing work.
	
	And the worst part, not having track of who sent what, when u get a message when u are typing and accidently press the Return key when the box pops up. The message dissappears with u not even realizing that you have lost a message.
	
	All this made me develop The NetSender :-)
	
	
	
	Features of NetSender
	1. A list of computers, to which you can send messages to.
	2. Select multiple computers to whom the net send message has to be sent.
	3. The other computer need not have this application running. The user on a machine without NetSender will receive the messages as normal Net Send Message and can send message to you via the normal Net Send command.
	4. Sits in the System Tray. 
	5. No more annoying and disturbing popups of net send messages. System Tray Icon flashes when new messages arrive.
	6. Stores all  the messages received and sent in the message box.
	7. Reply to a message received by double clicking on the sender name.
	8. Send large data, NetSender automatically breaks up the large message into smaller parts and send them.

	Please Note:
		NetSender currently will work only for Windows NT, 2000 and XP.
		It will not work for Win 9x.
		I need help from you guys find code to make NetSender work in Win 9x.
		
	I thank all the developers who provided sample code for many features at Planet-Source-Code.
